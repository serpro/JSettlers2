/**
 * This message from server to a client means that the client's player
 * is allowed to join the game. After this message, the client is sent
 * all relevant game and player information, and then their joining is
 * announced to all game members with {@link SOCJoinGame}.
 *<P>
 * <B>I18N:</B> If the game being joined uses a {@link soc.game.SOCScenario SOCScenario},
 * the client will need localized strings to explain the scenario as soon as the client
 * joins.  So, v2.0.00 sends those strings before this JOINGAMEAUTH message so that the
 * client will have them before showing the message dialog. The strings are sent using
 * {@link SOCLocalizedStrings}.
