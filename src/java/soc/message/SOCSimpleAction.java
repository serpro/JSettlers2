/**
 * This generic message from the server to clients handles a simple action or event for a client player in a game.
 * This is a way to add game actions and events without adding new SOCMessage subclasses.
 * It has a player number, an action type code, and two optional detail-value fields.
 * This message comes after, not before, any messages that update the game and player data for the action.
 *<P>
 * This message type is useful for functions that don't have a complicated set of
 * details attached, such as telling all players that someone has bought a development card,
 * or telling a bot that it's made a successful bank/port trade, or some event or condition just happened.
 *<P>
 * It can also be used to prompt the player that they may or must take some action at this time.
 * Action types that do this have {@code MAY_} or {@code MUST_} in their name.
 *<P>
 * Depending on the action type code, this message may be broadcast to the entire game
 * or sent to only the affected player.  Clients should ignore action types they don't
 * know how to handle (maybe the type is newer than the client's version).
 *<P>
 * Action type codes below 1000 are for general types that different kinds of games might be able to use.<BR>
 * Gametype-specific action types start at 1000.
